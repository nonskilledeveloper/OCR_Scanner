# OCR_Scanner

This software i wrote it for a friend, he asked me to wrote this since he constantly received such kind of lists with the purpose to send them a message, and he was very tired of writing down these numbers manually in his smartphone, this was a very repetitive task, and he asked me if i was able to authomatize it

## How to use it

We need a capture with phone numbers and usernames, like the following example:

This is petty similar to the one my friend was used to see. 
 
Now, we have to save this capture in the same folder as our OCR_Scanner, and the capture must to be named with the nombers starting from "1.png" (It also supports jpg images)

We would have something very similar to this

Now, we execute the OCR_Scanner from the terminal of our operating system

It will analyze all the captures that you add to the folder, in a few seconds, in this case i only used one capture, but you can add even hundreds

At the final, you have to do an "Enter" into the terminal, and you will get a csv document similar to this one

As it is a CSV file, it's possible to import these contacts to the telephone, some telephones can read contacts from a CSV file, others need to install an extra application, but it is completely possible, and it saves time when you need to write contacts this way for any reason
